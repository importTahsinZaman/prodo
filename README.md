# Overview

Prodo is a chrome extension built to help students stay productive by building a connection with a digital pet.

As the user completes assignments on a platform such as Google Classroom, their pet, AKA Prodo, gains xp and eventually levels up and evolves. Students can also use the built in pomodoro timer to help them stay on task and also take breaks as needed.
